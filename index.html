        <p> My favourite hobby is reading. I really don't remember when the never ending love for books started. But since then I have always been depending on books to provide me knowledge, enhance my vocabulary,and provide a much needed escape from my surroundings time and again. </p>
        <p>I think I started with adventure and mystery series of Enid Blyton but soon enough I had found myself delving into classics by Austen, fiction by Rowling or real life stories by Jeffrey Archer. Reading enriches our mind and I find figments and parts of my soul in these books.Also it increases your concentration and provides you insights in life of other people who may have walked the earth at certain point of time. </p>

            My Favourite book name is<i> <b>Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynmann</b></i>. This is an autobiographical book written by a Nobel Prize winning physicist. It was compiled together by Ralph Leighton and gives us an insight into the life of this curious guy. His outlook towards life in general and science in particular serves as an inspiration to many.</p>

        <p> I am a physics enthusiast. I read popular science books. Many a times, I read the autobiographies of famous physicists so as to derive inspiration from their lives and work. This gives me ideas of how to progress, the patience I should have while pursuing Science.</p>
        <p> One of the scientists who has inspired me is:-
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="_blank" > Richard Feynmann</a>. A humble person, jovial and always ready to experiment, he has made huge contributioons to the field of physics. Some of his famous sayings are:-</p>

      <p> Richard Feynmann was an amazing professor as well and he believed that teaching/explaining a concept makes sure that we ourselves understand our flaws. He said you can consider that you have understood something only if you can explain it in layman terms. And this is what I have been trying to do ever since. This realization, I think has changed the way I learn something. </p>
